**Color Picker Web App**

This is a simple web application that lets you pick a color and see it update in real-time!

**Project Breakdown:**

- **index.html:** This file builds the main structure of the web page and links to the stylesheet (`styles.css`) and JavaScript file (`script.js`).
- **styles.css:** This file controls the layout and appearance of the color picker elements.
- **script.js:** This file handles the functionality behind the color picker.

**How it Works:**

- The app uses a built-in color picker element to let you choose a color.
- Whenever you select a new color, the JavaScript code captures the chosen value.
- The code then updates two things:
  - The background color of a designated area to match your pick.
  - The text content that displays the chosen color value.

**Running the App:**

1. Save all three files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in the same folder.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the color picker to experiment with different colors!

**No Extra Libraries Needed!**

This code relies on standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionalities. You don't need any additional software.

**Get Creative!**

Feel free to customize the look and feel by modifying the styles in `styles.css`. You can even explore adding new features later on!
